# Objective
Smart contracts can remove costly errors and automate workflows within the traditional finance sector. Furthermore, smart contract technology has paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to provide financial services without unnecessary intermediaries to optimize efficiency and minimize costs. 
In this Project::

- We define a `InsuranceClaim` struct to represent an insurance claim.
- We implement methods to create, approve, and reject a claim.
- The main function initializes the Soroban client, defines the contract logic, and deploys the contract.

To deploy this contract, replace `"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"` and `"YOUR_SECRET_KEY"` with your Stellar account ID and secret key, respectively. Then, compile and run the Rust program.

Please note that this example is simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle error cases, security considerations, and potentially more complex contract logic. Additionally, ensure you're compliant with all regulations and legal requirements related to insurance claims and blockchain technology.
